# Rottwurst-Richtofen

An H3VR custom character that eliminates the sosigs with zosigs.

Currently removes all sosigs (non-zombie enemies) and replaces them with a suitable zozig (zombie sosig) replacement. The harder or special ones may drop a weapon, while the gun pools and holds have mostly remained untouched.

You can find a detail sheet of all holds, spawns, and how the character was built and paced inside of the [character details](https://github.com/nayr31/Rottwurst-Richtofen/blob/main/CharacterDetails.txt) file. This was the original descriptor of the mod, and may be different than the actual implementation.

For a complete list of zombie tags and their descriptions, take a look at the [official H3VR wiki page for zosig variants](https://h3vr.fandom.com/wiki/Rotwieners#Variants).
